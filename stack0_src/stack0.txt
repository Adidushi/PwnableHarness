This challenge is intended to be a beginner's exploitation challenge.

It is a simple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability, and the executable is
compiled without any vulnerability mitigations (ie there are no stack cookies and
the stack is executable).


To connect to this challenge, run the following:

    $ nc c0deh4cker.com 32101


This will connect you to the challenge running on my server.

There are two flags to be gained from this challenge:
1) Trick the program into thinking you purchased it.
2) Get a shell and read the second flag file.

Part 2 will require exploiting the service and getting a shell. The challenge
harness redirects all standard IO streams to the connected socket, so just
executing /bin/sh is good enough (ie no need to connect back to yourself). This
way, you don't have to open ports on your router or use a server.

I highly recommend downloading the challenge binary and running it on a local
linux system. Just remember to create a user named "ctf_stack0" and to run this program
as root (it needs root at first in order to prevent the server from being killed).
That way it can be run in a debugger (I suggest using gdb-peda for this).

Good luck!
